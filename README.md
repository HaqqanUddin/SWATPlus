# SWAT+ Model for Hydrological Modeling

This repository contains the SWAT+ model developed for the postgraduate course CE-580: Applied Hydrology. The model simulates hydrological processes in the Indiana River Watershed, located in Indiana State. It integrates high-resolution spatial and temporal data, including the Copernicus DEM for digital elevation modeling, SWAT+ inbuilt climate datasets, the SSURGO database for soil properties, and the NLCD for land use classification. The SWAT+ model provides comprehensive coverage of the watershed, supporting daily, monthly, and yearly hydrological simulations. This tool facilitates detailed analysis of water budget components such as surface runoff, groundwater flow, and streamflow dynamics, leveraging precise land use and soil data to ensure accurate and reliable modeling results.
